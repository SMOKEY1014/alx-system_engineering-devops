# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage 🕵️‍♂️

## Issue Summary

**Duration:**

- **Outage Start:** March 15, 2024, 08:00 AM GMT
- **Outage End:** March 15, 2024, 10:30 AM GMT

**Impact:**

- The main e-commerce website decided to take an unexpected coffee break, leaving 100% of users staring at a blank screen and wondering if they paid their internet bills. This caused a significant loss in sales and some serious customer eyebrow-raising.

**Root Cause:**

- The culprit was an exhausted database connection pool. It seems our application server didn't get the memo about pacing itself and ran out of connections, leaving everyone hanging.

## Timeline

- **08:00 AM GMT:** 🚨 _Alert!_ Monitoring system screamed, "Houston, we have a problem!"
- **08:05 AM GMT:** 🧑‍💻 Engineer on call confirmed the site was taking a siesta.
- **08:10 AM GMT:** 🕵️‍♂️ Investigation kicked off with a focus on web servers; suspected a DDoS attack.
- **08:30 AM GMT:** 🚧 Misleading path - Network logs were as clean as a whistle; no DDoS in sight.
- **08:45 AM GMT:** 🔄 Escalated to the database team after noticing slow query times.
- **09:00 AM GMT:** 🔍 Discovered all database connections were busy partying and not working.
- **09:15 AM GMT:** 🚧 Misleading path - Cache and load balancer configurations were given a once-over; nothing amiss.
- **09:30 AM GMT:** 🕵️‍♂️ Application logs revealed repeated connection timeouts.
- **09:45 AM GMT:** 🎯 Identified misconfiguration in the application server's connection pool settings.
- **10:00 AM GMT:** 🔧 Adjusted settings and restarted application servers.
- **10:30 AM GMT:** 🎉 Site back online, normal operations resumed.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
Our application server was too conservative with its connection pool size, resulting in a bottleneck when demand spiked. All available connections were used up, causing the website to become unresponsive.

**Resolution:**  
We increased the connection pool size in the application server configuration to handle more connections. Restarting the servers applied the new settings, and we added monitoring to keep an eye on the connection pool usage in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**

- **Increase Connection Pool Size:** Give the connection pool some breathing room to handle peak traffic.
- **Monitor Connection Pool Usage:** Keep an eagle eye on connection usage and alert if it gets too high.
- **Optimize Database Queries:** Make queries lean and mean to avoid hogging connections.
- **Regular Load Testing:** Stress test the system regularly to ensure it can handle traffic spikes.
- **Review Configuration Management:** Ensure settings are optimized for performance and scalability.

**Tasks:**

1. **Patch Application Server:** Roll out the updated configuration settings across all environments.
2. **Add Monitoring:** Implement detailed monitoring for database connection pool usage.
3. **Optimize Queries:** Audit and fine-tune database queries to reduce connection hold times.
4. **Conduct Load Testing:** Schedule and perform regular load tests to validate system performance.
5. **Review and Update Documentation:** Update internal documentation to reflect new configuration settings and monitoring protocols.

By addressing these issues, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and ensure our web stack is as reliable as a Swiss watch.
