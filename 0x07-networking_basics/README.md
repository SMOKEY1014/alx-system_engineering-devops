# OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.

* It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

* The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
* The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc
* Keep in mind that the OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.

## In this project we will mainly focus on:

* The Transport layer and especially TCP/UDP
* On the Network layer with IP and ICMP
* The image bellow describes more concretely how you can relate to every level.
